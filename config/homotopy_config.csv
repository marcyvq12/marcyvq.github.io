"text","","Homotopy is a large-scale rope sculpture inspired by the mathematical fields of topology and knot theory. The sculpture is composed of three separate bands of rope webbing intertwined together to form a Borromean braid. <br> <br> This work was built by Marceline and a small team of assistants. It was displayed at Ropecraft Chicago 2019, where Marceline was invited as an Artist-in-Residence and educator.","100","","","","","","","text-align:center;"

"text","The life of an object","As the viewer interacts with the sculpture, the shape and tension in the rope changes. Although the design is geometric in nature, its form is still organic, responding to participants with a life of its own.","40","","","","","","",""

"text","Design","This work was researched and designed in the weeks before construction. Each band is tied separately, with edges connecting to corners of the external cube structure. Support lines create the shape of the bands, which are then filled in with webbing.","40","","","","","","",""
