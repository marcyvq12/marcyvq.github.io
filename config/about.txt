<p>Marceline VQ is an internationally recognized shibari artist whose work challenges viewers with intricate aesthetic concepts and complex rope techniques. She engages rope from all perspectives -- as a model in her own rope, with others in her rope and as a model for others’ rope work, allowing for a deeper understanding of the medium as a creative and connective tool. She adores the sensory experience of being bound in rope, as well as the transformation in becoming a “human sculpture,” which influences her unique artistic perspective. Marceline’s work engages in conversation with themes from quantitative disciplines, including geometry and physics, and themes from qualitative disciplines such as analytic philosophy and universal empathy. She has studied with shibari communities across the globe, is classically trained in visual fine arts, and finds inspiration in the works of Chiharu Shiota, Olafur Eliasson, and Tomas Saraceno.</p> <p>Marceline is based in NYC and works to create rope imagery that is surprising and inventive with her model and co-creator Anya Demure.</p>
