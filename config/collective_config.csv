"text","Corlears Hook Park","This land has a fascinating history. Before the bridges were constructed this area was the ferry port to Brooklyn - and also the largest concentration of brothels, 87 to be exact (this is where the term “hooker” comes from). Most were woman owned & run and sex work was one of the only ways women could have a decent wage & independence and many took pride in their practice. The wealthiest woman in America in the 1830s was Madame Eliza Jumel. We honor this space and these women with stereo views of women from that time period. ","50","","","","","","",""

"text","","<b>Collective Museum</b> is a social enterprise that provides tools, space, and support for ordinary people to create anything they can imagine. <br>
Our vision is to build museums around the world, starting with NYC, that provide tools, space, and support for ordinary people to create anything they can imagine. We believe that all individuals possess untapped curiosity. To this end, Collective provides a framework to discover and grow that curiosity through exploration and experimentation. Once in that flow of discovery, you can reclaim your creative right and give yourself permission to play. It is the goal of our programming to create opportunities for all adults to seduce their own imagination and follow it to a place of inspiration and action. ","40","","","","","","",""
