"text","","This large-scale rope sculpture draws viewers in with its intricate yet minimal design. Light streams in through the central negative space and the webbing extending towards the edges of the external cube. <br> This work was built by Marceline and a small team of assistants. It was displayed at Tethered Together 2019, where Marceline was invited as an artist and educator.","50","","","","","","",""

"text","Taking up space","Marcelineâ€™s work engages with the dimensionality of space. The rope acts as a one-dimensional object embedded in a 3D world, and when tied together into a structure, becomes something new entirely. The camera, too, imposes its own dimensional constraints, projecting a 3D object onto 2D space. The interplay of each of these elements is a central theme in the Portal series.","40","","","","","","",""
