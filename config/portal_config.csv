"text","Taking up space","Marcelineâ€™s work engages with the playful dimensionality of space. The rope acts as a one-dimensional object embedded in a 3D world and, when tied together into a structure, becomes something entirely new. The camera, too, imposes its own dimensional constraints, projecting a 3D object onto 2D space. The interplay of each of these elements create a central theme in the Portal series for audiences to engage with.","60","","","","","","",""
