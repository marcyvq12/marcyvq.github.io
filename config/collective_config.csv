"text","Corlears Hook Park","This land has a fascinating history. Before the bridges were constructed this area was the ferry port to Brooklyn - and also the largest concentration of brothels, 87 to be exact (this is where the term “hooker” comes from). Most were woman owned & run and sex work was one of the only ways women could have a decent wage & independence and many took pride in their practice. The wealthiest woman in America in the 1830s was Madame Eliza Jumel. We honor this space and these women with stereo views of women from that time period. ","50","","","","","","",""
